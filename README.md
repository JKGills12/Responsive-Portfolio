# Responsive-Portfolio

## Not my best work, but I'm still learning about how to use the correct tags to best serve my purpose. I know having a plan of layout would've helped in me being able to have a better looking layout than what I currently have. Plus, naming the tags with a descriptive name would've helped me better with matching what code goes with what is on the portfolio. 

## As for the responsive web, again, it would have been easier if I had correctly named each id/class. That would have helped me in knowing what would respond to the different screen sizes.

## I wish a had a little more time to fix my mistakes, but this is a learning experience and I will not make the same mistakes twice. I will be practcing media queries more and making sure to name classes and ids better.

###I really hoped I could have figured out how to fix my page to have it respond to the different screen sizes, but it turns out it was a little more difficult for me to do right now. The layout wasn't what I was hoping for. There were things I wanted centered but it just wouldn't move! And then things would move out of place when I tested out the media queries I had set up.
